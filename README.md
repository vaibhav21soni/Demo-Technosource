# MERN CRUD

A simple records system using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js with real-time Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using Socket.io.

REST API was implemented on the back-end. Semantic UI React was used for the UI in the front-end.

  db: "mongodb://localhost/mern-crud",
  react_app_url: "http://localhost:4200"
};
```

## Back-end
Install the dependencies via the terminal.
```bash
npm install
```

```bash
cd react-src
```

Install the dependencies required by React.
```bash
npm install
```

Run the *development server* for React.
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm start
